The three files in this directory accompany the article, "U.S. State Policy Index for Population
Health Analyses," by Montez, Gutin, and Monnat, published in The Milbank Quarterly. 

The three file are in Stata format and include the following:
(1) SPPD_V1_3.1.dta: this is the version of the State Policy & Politics Database used to create the index, (2) create_indices.do: this is the do-file that reads SPPD_V1_3.1.dta and creates the index, and (3) policies_and_indices.dta: this is the output of the create_indices.do file. It contains the index.

The annual index calculated here and in the article spans 1980 to 2023. 

Current versions of the State Policy & Politics Database and annual updates of the policy index are posted on the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research website at www.icpsr.umich.edu/sites/icpsr/home
